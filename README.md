# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Design a machine learning model to categorize the sentiment of the tweets. This has been implemented as part of the course project.

In NLP research, sentiment analysis is an active area of interest. It deals with predicting the opinion of a given text/sentence. It has many names such as Opinion Mining, Sentiment Mining, and Subjectivity Analysis. Sentiment Analysis helps companies and organizations in making data-driven decisions. It has a lot of applications such as chatbot, product reviews, aspect reviews, and so on. Here, we focused on sentence level sentiment analysis. It involves understanding the sentence word by word to obtain the semantic meaning of a sentence.

## Overview
The goal is to design a machine learning model to classify the sentiment of the tweets into three classes labels positive, negative, and neutral. we worked on two different datasets  that contains the tweets during a presidential debate between Obama and Romney few years ago. The performance of the models is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score of the positive, neutral and negative classes. We were successfully able to design the model, perform training according to the nature of data to predict the class labels for the provided test tweets.

## Techniques
There are various techniques involved here.

### Data Preprocessing

### Data Analysis

### Feature Engineering

### Modelling


## Experiment Outcomes
The highlighted classifiers are the final models used for corresponding Obama, Romney datasets.
Following are the evaluation metrics captured for all the models except Voting Classifier:
